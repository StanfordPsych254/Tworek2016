##Justification

I chose Tworek & Cimpian (2016) to replicate because I'm interested in moral cognition, particularly the development of moral cognition. Although my current work is in development, I wanted to do a study with adults, as most of the time I would have available to go to Bing is already devoted to my thesis work. 

In the paper, Tworek & Cimpian look at the role the inherence bias (the tendency to give explanations based on intrinsic facts) plays in inferring moral values ("ought" statements) from factual statements ("is" statements). They conducted 5 experiments--3 with adult participants and 2 with child participants. 

I will replicate Experiment 2, which found that the presence of inherence bias in participants' explanations was positively correlated with participants' ought inferences, but only when reasoning about typical behaviors (e.g., "Should people give roses as gifts on Valentine's Day?"). 

##Stimuli and procedures

The original experiment was conducted on MTurk with 112 adult participants. All stimuli consisted of written sentences, all of which are available online at the Open Science Framework. There are two parts: ought inferences and inherence bias. To examine ought inferences, participants were presented with 12 behaviors (e.g., people typically give roses as gifts on Valentine's Day). Each behavior was part of a typical-atypical pair, but each participant was shown only one member of the pair. Participants were asked two ought questions about each behavior, one involving a "should" question and the other a "wrong or right" question. Inherence bias was measured as a relative preference for inherent over extrinsic explanations (on a "disagree strongly" to "agree strongly" scale). All explanations used in the original experiment are also available on OSF. As a control, the authors also conducted the Cognitive Reflection Test, as it would be possible that a link between inherence bias and tendency to make ought inferences could be explained by a tendency to think heuristically, rather than analytically. 

##Challenges

I think the main challenge will be getting everything up and running on MTurk, as I've never conducted an experiment online. Another challenge will be matching the questionnaire format as closely as possible.
